								<p>Accessibility and design plays an important role in website design, and it should be incorporated into every visual and content centered aspect of one's website. Moreover, my website will follow the brand guidelines of Western Illinois University which will help cater to those with disabilities who would like to experience my website and would like to explore the content on the website. 

									My website will use graphics that feature alt text that use plain language (Accessibility for Teams, n.d.). Another aspect of my website will include color contrast that is easy for the reader to view the content and clearly shows variations in different colors within the page. These color variations will also follow the colors used on the WIU Brand Guidelines. 
									
									Layout and Hierarchy will also play an important role within my website in regard to accessibility and design. One important aspect is to have headings in a larger font size, bolded, and in the colors in the brand guidelines. All text will also be left aligned so users can easily read text just like they would read traditional physical texts. 
									
									Navigating a website should be seamless for all users who have impairments and also for users who do not. Websites must cater to diverse audiences, and it should reflect on the abilities of all types of users. Therefore, my website will include elements of design that are easy to navigate and experience for all users. Overall, user experience will be enhanced by design aspects utilized on my website due to their readability and nature of design.</p>
