								<p>When considering how to begin fundraising, it is important to choose the correct tactics that will help one raise the most amount of money with limited cost, fundraise with a simple yet popular product, and fundraise in a way that is intriguing to all audiences. So, when considering the best fundraising tactic, I chose grilled cheese. 

									“Cheesy with the Dee Zees” has been a tagline used by the Delta Zeta sorority for various philanthropy events that are centered around a dinner fundraiser with a cheese based item. In the past, my chapter has used mac and cheese as the main fundraising item. However, after careful consideration I decided to change the food item once I received the position of Vice President of Philanthropy. This change of food item was decided after evaluation of the performance of mac and cheese. Mac and cheese is much harder to make at such a large capacity without running into issues like overcooked noodles or lack of freshness. Thus, grilled cheese became the new food item. 
									
									As a fundraising event, the first thing we took into consideration is how we can make the event appealing to the community. So, we took the idea of grilled cheese and ran with the idea. We thought to ourselves about the color scheme, food sides, decoration, and marketing strategies that could appeal to the public and rebrand our event to redeem ourselves from the issues we had in the past with mac and cheese.  Overall, grilled cheese became the center of our attention. We perfected a recipe based on the research that was mentioned in the previous posts, and we prioritized the quality of the ingredients while sticking to a strict budget of $500. These aspects became the center of our planning schedule, and ultimately led to a successful event.
