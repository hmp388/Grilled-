								<p>Grilled cheese sandwiches range far and wide in their complexity. From the grilled cheese sandwich made from Kraft Single Cheese Slices and plain white bread to The BEST Gourmet Grilled Cheese Sandwich made with fresh sourdough and camembert cheese–these sandwiches are the icon of comfort. A grilled cheese sandwich is essentially the definition of a quick and easy meal that can be fancied up or simplified to the bare minimum. The History of the Grilled Cheese that we know and love today was popularized in the 1920s during the Great Depression. FreshMelt, who provided a brief history of grilled cheese, mentioned that the food item was used as a quick and cheap meal that could power Americans through their workday during the Great Depression (2019). 

                                    Kraft Single Cheese Slices have become a staple of the simplified grilled cheese. Made in 1916 by James Kraft, the processed cheese became popularized over time (Wilson, 2012). However, many people tend to stray away from this cheese due to the taste and the overall properties of the cheese–including myself. Despite the mixed feelings of Kraft singles, grilled cheese can be accompanied with any type of cheese that a chef desires. With a simplified dish like grilled cheese, my favorite part is the creative freedom one can have. From experimenting with different cheeses, breads, butters, and toppings–grilled cheese can contain a multitude of combinations!
                                    
                                    Grilled cheese came from simple and humble beginnings that relate to the time period of the Great Depression. However, over time the grilled cheese has been amplified into whatever culinary design we choose to use.From being iconically paired with Campbell’s Tomato Soup to making its way into high class kitchen–the food is not limited to one location or chef. Not only is this simple food item a pathway for creativity, but grilled cheese is continuously seen as comforting and delicious.
